## Underwater imaging

Visual perception in underwater scenarios is **hard**.
In order to understand how and why, let's have a look at this 360ยบ video recorded by some of my colleagues:

<div align="center">

Even though the visibility conditions on this video were *almost optimal*, we can already identify two main challenges:
- First, the floating particles in the water blur the image and make it lose the sharpness of its features.
- Second, the high attenuation rate of water means that light loses most of its power at distances in the order of meters or tens of meters, depending on its wavelength:

A robust solution against these factors is using sonar.
Sonars are range sensors that use ultrasonic waves to acquire geometrical information about their surroundings.
Ultrasonic waves are mechanical waves and can therefore propagate further and are not affected by water turbidity and varying lighting conditions.
However, they typically produce much noisier results and their resolution is in the order of tens of centimeters.

- due to [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction).
