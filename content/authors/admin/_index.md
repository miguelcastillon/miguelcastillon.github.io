I’m the **autonomous navigation lead** at Keybotic, a start-up developing **four-legged robots** for industrial inspections. Before this, I did my **PhD on 3D perception and navigation** of autonomous underwater robots: theory, software development and field tests. My main research interests intertwine
**numerical optimization and sensor perception** for autonomous navigation in challenging scenarios.
