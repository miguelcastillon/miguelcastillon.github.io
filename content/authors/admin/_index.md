I’m a PhD student at the Underwater Robotics Lab of University of Girona under the supervision of Prof. Pere Ridao. 

My main research interests include exploiting sensor perception for autonomous navigation and manipulation in challenging scenarios.

I’m currently investigating novel non-rigid data association methods to recover true object shape out of distorted 3D scans.
