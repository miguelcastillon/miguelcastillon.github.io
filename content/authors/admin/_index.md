I’m a PhD student at the Underwater Robotics Lab of University of Girona. 
My main research interests include exploiting sensor perception for autonomous navigation and manipulation in challenging scenarios.
I’m currently working on graph SLAM and investigating novel non-rigid data association methods to recover true object shape out of distorted 3D scans.
