abstract: Underwater inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) operations are
  being increasingly robotized in order to reduce safety issues and costs. These
  robotic systems rely on vision sensors to perform fundamental tasks, such as
  navigation and object recognition and manipulation. Especially, active optical
  3D scanners are commonly used due to the domain-specific challenges of
  underwater imaging. This paper presents an exhaustive survey on the state of
  the art of optical 3D underwater scanners. A literature review on light
  projection and light-sensing technologies is presented. Moreover, quantitative
  performance comparisons of underwater 3D scanners present in the literature
  and commercial products are carried out.
