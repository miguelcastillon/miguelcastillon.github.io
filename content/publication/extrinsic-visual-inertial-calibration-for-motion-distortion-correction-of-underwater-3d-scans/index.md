abstract: Underwater 3D laser scanners are an essential type of sensor used by
  unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for operations such as navigation,
  inspection, and object recognition and manipulation. Scanners that acquire 3D
  data by sweeping a laser plane across the scene can provide very high lateral
  resolution. However, their data may suffer from rolling shutter effect if the
  change of pose of the robot with respect to the scanned target during the
  sweep is not negligible. In order to compensate for motion-related distortions
  without the need for point cloud postprocessing, the 6-DoF pose at which the
  scanner acquires each line needs to be accurately known. In the underwater
  domain, autonomous vehicles are often equipped with a high-end inertial
  navigation system (INS) that provides reliable navigation data. Nonetheless,
  the relative pose of the 3D scanner with respect to the inertial reference
  frame of the robot is not usually known a priori. Therefore, this paper uses
  an ego-motion-based calibration algorithm to calibrate the extrinsic
  parameters of the visual-inertial sensor pair. Simulations are performed to
  quantify how miscalibration affects motion-related distortion. The method is
  also evaluated experimentally in laboratory conditions.
