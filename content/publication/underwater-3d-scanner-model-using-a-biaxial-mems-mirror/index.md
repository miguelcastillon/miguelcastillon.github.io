abstract: Underwater 3D laser scanners are an essential type of sensor used by
  unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for operations such as navigation,
  inspection and object recognition and manipulation. These sensors need to be
  able to provide highly accurate 3D data at fast refresh rates in order to
  accomplish these tasks. Usually, these scanners rely on a rotating mirror
  actuated by a galvanometer. However, the light planes steered by this type of
  mirrors are typically deformed into cones due to refraction. In order to
  produce accurate results, this distortion needs to be taken into account,
  which increases the computational cost of the 3D reconstruction. A novel
  approach consisting in using a biaxial MEMS mirror is proposed in this paper.
  The second rotational degree of freedom of the mirror can be used to project
  optimally curved light shapes, so that the refraction process transforms them
  into planes. Being able to model the light surfaces as planes rather than
  cones can significantly reduce the computation time of the 3D reconstruction.
  In order to do so, an exhaustive model of the complete light trajectories is
  presented. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper constitutes the
  first attempt to model and counteract the distortion in the scanning pattern
  introduced by a biaxial mirror and a double refraction process in the context
  of underwater robotics.
