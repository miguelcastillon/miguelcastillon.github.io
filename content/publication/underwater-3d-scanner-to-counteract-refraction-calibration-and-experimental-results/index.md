abstract: "Underwater 3D laser scanners are an essential type of sensor used by
  unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for operations such as inspection,
  navigation, and object recognition and manipulation. This paper presents a
  novel 3D laser scanner, which uses a 2-axis mirror to project straight lines
  into the water by compensating for refraction-related distortions. This is
  achieved by projecting optimally-curved lines, so that the refraction when
  they enter the water transforms them into straight lines. The relevance of
  this approach lies in the fact that 3D triangulation using planes is
  noticeably faster than using elliptic cones. The goal of this work is twofold:
  i) to prove that refraction-related distortions can in practice be compensated
  for by using a 2-axis mirror, and ii) to present a simple calibration
  algorithm that only needs to compute the coefficients of polynomial functions.
  To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, the prototype presented in this paper
  is the first laser line scanner (LLS) that actively counteracts the refraction
  of the projected light in the context of underwater robotics."
